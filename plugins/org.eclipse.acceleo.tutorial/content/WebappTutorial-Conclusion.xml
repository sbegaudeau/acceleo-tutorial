         You can now improve your tooling in order to be able to match the generator provided in the solution.
         During this tutorial, we have only created a small version of the complete web application tutorial, you can
         use all the concepts available in the meta-model described at the beginning of the tutorial to build a complete
         web application generator similar to the one provided during this tutorial.<br />
         <br />
         You can also go further with EEF by modifying the models generated by EEF to influence the design of the EEF
         editor generated for the meta-model.
